# Why Openly Bipolar People Should Not Be Medicated

## Parallel with Alan Turing

[Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) is known as one
of the fathers of theoretical computer science, and he also played an
instrumental role in protecting Britain against the attacks of the German
Nazi forces during WWII.

However, Turing is also remembered that because he was openly
[gay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality), he was forced to be
treated with medication to resolve his homosexuality, was hospitalised and
eventually was led to commit suicide.

In 2019, most developed countries accept homosexual and bisexual individuals
as fully sane and acceptable, and do not try to medicate the homosexuality out
of them. Here in Israel, openly gay, bisexual and lesbian individuals are
subject to the same rights and responsibilities as straight individuals, and
while a few issues are still a matter of unresolved debate, a gay person
can lead a fully normal and healthy life, without being sedated and medicated.

But it's not all roses.

## Hypomania and MDD as the new Homosexuality:

I have had [Major depressive disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder) and
[Hypomanias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania) and even one major
[Mania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mania) and several shorter manias.
This is documented on my [homesite](https://www.shlomifish.org/) and
other online social media writing.

Now here is a revelation:

```
post-WWII :: Turing :: homosexuality <=> 2019 :: Me (= Shlomi Fish) :: Hypomanias
```

And I have been medicated and sedated with harmful drugs and now hospitalised
in a psychiatric ward, where my access to the outside world is an
interconnected Windows 7 computer full of malware, instead of the
better managed GNU/Linux boxes I can use at home, along with all my online
accounts, which I'd rather not access here (for security reasons).

A committee of several experts has made me stay in the ward for several
two week segments, trying to rehabiltate me, while I would be happier in my room
at home. I missed [Rosh Hashanah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosh_Hashanah) and
[International Talk Like a Pirate Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Talk_Like_a_Pirate_Day) -
two of my favourite holidays and I am about to miss
[Yom Kippur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Kippur) and [Sukkot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukkot), which sports the [ICon Festival](http://2019.iconfestival.org.il/) which I find very inspiring.

Someone asked me if I feel I am comparable to Turing. Well, according to
[my Résumé as a writer and entertainer](https://www.shlomifish.org/me/resumes/Shlomi-Fish-Resume-as-Writer-Entertainer.html)
I am even comparable to such historical great people as
[Larry Wall]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall (who is also quite obscure),
[Sesame Street]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_Street ,
[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer ,
[The Beatles]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles , and
other [hacker monarchs](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#hacker-monarchs).

Right now I am playing the old ["fox-in-the-hens'-coop"](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#fox-in-the-hens-coop) motif like
[Joseph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_%28Genesis%29) in prison,
or Summer Glau in [Summerschool at the NSA](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/) , in which case what happens when you put a
[Great Hacker/Action Hero](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#great-hackers) in a secluded place with many
minor hackers, and several lazy "I just work here" people who do their job
in the worst possible manner, is not a crashed great hacker, but instead many
happy hackers workers who are happy to provide their customers with royalty
service, even if they are not paid a lot to do it, and many hacker or great
hacker inmates.

## Taylor Swift as a hypomania-"sufferer"

If you're into contemporary music, you likely have heard of [Taylor
Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift), a very successful
singer-songwriter who is known for her interesting narrated lyrics, positively
extravagant and mind-blowing videos, constant philantropism (which does not
prevent her from becoming richer), and a rich YouTube culture of youtubers who
cover her songs, parody them, remix them, and comment on them. I realised that
she became a [Hacker Monarch](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#hacker-monarchs) - one of
several by the time I and other [freenode](https://freenode.net)ers [joked](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-gnu--think-big) about
her suing Apple Inc. for using the "Swift" trademark for [Apple
Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_%40programming_language%41).

Now here is a revelation, based on the [lyrics](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=lyrics+taylor+swift+shake+it+off) to Swift's [hit song "Shake It Off"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfWlot6h_JM): "I stay up too late" , "got nothing on my brain"
it seems that she is often hypomanic but instead of battling it, she enjoys
it as she is more creative, more energetic, more insightful and more socialable
and interesting.

## Hypomania is OK:

Hypomania has been believed to be treatable with medication, just like
homosexuality in Turing's time, but I pretty much know the medication only
causes many harmful side-effects, and in my case increasingly deprives me of
physical energy. My parents thought that using these drugs allowed me to
graduate from a B.Sc. in [EE in the
Technion](https://github.com/shlomif/my-real-person-fan-fiction#the-technion-vs-project-euler),
but not only did they not help, but I now know that these were the 6 and a half
most soul destroying, unproductive, useless, and uninspiring years of my life.
And that was because the only reason I continued to learn there was
because I wanted to get the diploma so I'll get more lucrative, higher paying,
jobs. If I studied in the Technion or elsewhere, because it was fun, and to
expand my horizons, or become a more effective writer / software developer /
[amateur](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=paul-graham-what-ameteur-meant)
philosopher / entertainer , then it would be less of a torture.

In this day and age people can learn enough about all that by starting from [my
homesite - www.shlomifish.org](https://www.shlomifish.org/) and following the
text of the essays, stories and screenplays, and links. While it took me a long
time to hone my skills to my level, I wish future people who wish to try to
emulate me, to have an easier time. I may be a badass writer and entertainer,
but given that I know I should ["Publish or
Perish"](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/NSA/) and love to share
my wisdom and knowledge anyway, and wish people to learn from my mistakes and
my successes.

Most of my screenplays, stories, bits, factoids, [the few videos I have on
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/ShlomiFish) (they are very lame compared
to the videos of Taylor Swift, but they are a start),
[my tweets](https://twitter.com/shlomif) etc. were inspired by thoughts I had
during hypomanias, and I quite enjoy it.

Sometimes I get into periods of mild
[depressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder) during
which I like to code a lot and to chat less passionately and philosophically on
IRC. Or I get into "deep work mode" when I write or
[refactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring) / transition a lot
of code or churn a large amount of text. These are also ok.

Taylor Swift should not be worried from being medicated for being Bipolar.
She may do "strange" things such as:

* Paying for anything she orders from a meal down to a soft drink, a glass of juice, or even some water, with a 50 USD bill telling the vendor/waiter to keep the change or donate it to charity (or give to her only to witness her putting
it on one table).
* Walk alone in the neighbourhood thinking.
* Staying up at night chatting in social media chat rooms (e.g. [Freenode](https://freenode.net), [Discord](https://discordapp.com), [Telegram](https://telegram.org), and [many others](https://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/How_Alternatives_Proliferate/)), while ordering food or drinks from time to time.
* Engage in conversations with complete strangers, to whom she will even gladly [give money](https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1175578541292957696).
* Eat various foods based upon a whim. I once ordered a warm pasta meal in the morning, and the restaurant complied.

Policemen are unlikely to detain her,
and she can use social engineering and [Saladin style](http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Saladin_Style/) benevolent psychological warfare so they just give
her a ride back home, or leave her alone while thinking that her
behaviour just "comes with the territory".

Perhaps I have mischaracterised Ms. Swift here, but the point is that these
behaviours, although eccentric, unconventional, and non-conformist are perfectly
logical, and I will do the same if I were a wealthy bipolar person.

## The Sad Story of My Treatment:

However, I am not so lucky.

In the break after my second Technion semester, I started writing [The One With
The Fountainhead](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TOneW-the-Fountainhead/) - which is a
parodical crossover of [Ayn Rand's The
Fountainhead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fountainhead) and [the Friends
T.V. show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends), and which is one of the
funniest, most politically incorrect, and yet some people's favourite of my
screenplays.

Moreover, I corresponded with my friend [Omer Zak](https://zak.co.il/) and
we came up with the opening meme to the [Summerschool at the NSA](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/SummerNSA/) effort.

All of this made me maniacal and out of control and I came up with an imaginary
reality where [Star Trek DS9](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine), [Buffy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer),
[Sabrina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_the_Teenage_Witch_%281996_TV_series%29), [CEIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarissa_Explains_It_All)
[Neo-Tech](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Neo-Tech), various
characters from [Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism)
, some of their actors, and some of my own friends and relatives, were real and
integrated together, and believed this was true.

I had done a lot of crazy stuff during my mania, but eventually a psychiatrist
asked me if I thought if it sounded logical that I could read other people's
minds, and I told him it didn't. As a result, I snapped out of the mania.

Afterwards, I have been treated with harmful drugs that had many side effects,
and did not prevent future hypomanias or other mood swings. Furthermore, my
hypomanias were incredibly productive for me resulting in stuff I placed on [my
homesite](https://www.shlomifish.org/) - and on other social media sites, and
which many similar minded hackers (both male and female) enjoyed, complimented
me for it, thought they were funny, or alternatively thought they were
[blasphemous (which indicates they were
true)](http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/).

But the people who wanted me to be "mentally healthy" told me these things
were irrational, wrong, "schema-driven" and that they were nonsense and that I
should not give them weight.

They were wrong! They were insightful, fresh, and endured their time.

Now, while I have suffered from many harmful antipsychotics - [it may still be
fixed](https://twitter.com/shc_mo/status/1180165973556506626) but what if
instead of these harmful legal drugs, I would have been treated with good
therapy, possibly
[CBT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy) or more
preferably
[Saladin-style](http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Saladin_Style/) benevolent
therapy.

How many potential Taylor Swifts were forced to be a "Shlomi Fish" like me, who
despite all was very productive and insightful, or were just hospitalised and
sedated and fought against by mediocre minds, who think conformism is mental
health, while [it is the
opposite](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/).
Furthermore, conformism leads to [Superior
orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_orders), including the "I just
work here" [small minded
attitude](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2004/12/06/news-45/) which leads to
sadism and vandalism and loss of lives and property that took a lot of effort
to construct by hard working, enthusiastic individuals.

So I say: "do what you want, not what you feel you must. The choice is in
your hands. Whatever you do, I'll accept that." These words go back at least to
[Moses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses), were [exemplified by
Saladin](http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Saladin_Style/) and were
extended and conveyed by greater and greater "memes" including the [Taylor
Swift "Shake it Off" song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7HiMv5jygk) and the
somewhat more established ["Highway to Hell" by
AC/DC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2RZXeQc5HU) (these are both links to my
favourite covers of them).

## A Million Psychiatrists can be wrong

Some people think that a million psychiatrists (and the mass media) cannot be
wrong, but they can. In other news, everyone [knows the Earth is flat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth),
and that the [sun and all the planets revolve around the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei),
and that [all species of animals were created about 6,000 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin),
and that [unmarried couples living together and having premarital sex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell)
is unethical and immoral. And, naturally, homosexual individuals are a threat
to society and must be medicated and sedated.
