Parallel with Alan Turing

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing[Alan Turing] is known as one
of the fathers of theoretical computer science, and he also played an
instrumental role in protecting Britain against the attacks of the
German Nazi forces during WWII.

However, Turing is also remembered that because he was openly
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality[gay], he was forced to be
treated with medication to resolve his homosexuality, was hospitalised
and eventually was led to commit suicide.

In 2019, most developed countries accept homosexual and bisexual
individuals as fully sane and acceptable, and do not try to medicate the
homosexuality out of them. Here in Israel, openly gay, bisexual and
lesbian individuals are subject to the same rights and responsibilities
as straight individuals, and while a few issues are still a matter of
unresolved debate, a gay person can lead a fully normal and healthy
life, without being sedated and medicated.

But it’s not all roses.

[id="hypomania_as_new_homosexuality"]
Hypomania and MDD as the new Homosexuality:
-------------------------------------------

I have had https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder[Major
depressive disorders] and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania[Hypomanias] and even one major
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mania[Mania] and several shorter manias.
This is documented on my https://www.shlomifish.org/[homesite] and other
online social media writing.

Now here is a revelation:

....
post-WWII :: Turing :: homosexuality <=> 2019 :: Me (= Shlomi Fish) :: Hypomanias
....

And I have been medicated and sedated with harmful drugs and now
hospitalised in a psychiatric ward, where my access to the outside world
is an interconnected Windows 7 computer full of malware, instead of the
better managed https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_linux[GNU/Linux desktop] boxes I can use at home, along with all my online accounts,
which I’d rather not access here (for security reasons).

A committee of several experts has made me stay in the ward for several
two week segments, trying to rehabiltate me, while I would be happier
and receive better therapy in my room at home. I missed
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosh_Hashanah[Rosh Hashanah] and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Talk_Like_a_Pirate_Day[International
Talk Like a Pirate Day] - two of my favourite holidays and I am about to
miss https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Kippur[Yom Kippur] and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukkot[Sukkot], which sports the
http://2019.iconfestival.org.il/[ICon Festival] which I find very
inspiring.

Someone asked me if I feel I am comparable to Turing. Well, according to
https://www.shlomifish.org/me/resumes/Shlomi-Fish-Resume-as-Writer-Entertainer.html[my Résumé as a writer and entertainer] I am even comparable to such
historical great people as
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall[Larry Wall] (who is also quite
obscure), https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_Street[Sesame Street] ,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer[Buffy the Vampire Slayer] , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles[The Beatles] , and
other
https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#hacker-monarchs[hacker monarchs].

Right now I am playing the old
https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#fox-in-the-hens-coop["fox-in-the-hens’-coop"]
motif like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_%28Genesis%29[the biblical Joseph] in prison, or Summer Glau in
https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/[Summerschool at the NSA] , in which case what happens when you put a
https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#great-hackers[Great Hacker/Action Hero] in a secluded place with many minor hackers, and
several lazy "I just work here" people who do their job in the worst
possible manner, is not a crashed great hacker, but instead many happy
hackers workers who are happy to provide their customers with royalty
service, even if they are not paid a lot to do it, and many hacker or
great hacker inmates.

[id="taylor_swift"]
Taylor Swift as a hypomania-"sufferer"
--------------------------------------

image::./taylor_swift.webp[Photo of Taylor Swift]

If you’re into contemporary music, you likely have heard of
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift[Taylor Swift], a very
successful singer-songwriter who is known for her interesting narrated
lyrics, positively extravagant and mind-blowing videos, constant
philantropism (which does not prevent her from becoming richer), and a
rich YouTube culture of youtubers who cover her songs, parody them,
remix them, and comment on them. I realised that she became a
https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#hacker-monarchs[Hacker Monarch] - one of several by the time I and other
https://freenode.net[freenode]ers
https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-gnu--think-big[joked]
about her suing Apple Inc. for using the "Swift" trademark for
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_%40programming_language%41[Apple Swift].

Now here is a revelation: based on the
https://duckduckgo.com/?q=lyrics+taylor+swift+shake+it+off[lyrics] to
Swift’s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfWlot6h_JM[hit song "Shake It
Off"]: "I stay up too late" , "got nothing on my brain" it seems
that she is often hypomanic but instead of battling it, she enjoys it as
she is more creative, more energetic, more insightful and more
socialable and interesting.

[id="hypomania_is_ok"]
Hypomania is OK
---------------

Hypomania has been believed to be treatable with medication, just like
homosexuality in Turing’s time, but I pretty much know the medication
only causes many harmful side-effects, and in my case increasingly
deprives me of physical energy. My parents thought that using these
drugs allowed me to graduate from a B.Sc. in
https://github.com/shlomif/my-real-person-fan-fiction#the-technion-vs-project-euler[EE in the Technion]. Hoerver, not only did they not help, but I now know
that these were the 6 and a half most soul destroying, unproductive,
useless, and uninspiring years of my life.

That was because the only reason I continued to learn there was because
I wanted to get the diploma so I’ll get more lucrative, higher paying,
jobs. If I studied in the Technion or elsewhere, because it was fun, and
to expand my horizons, or become a more effective writer / software
developer /
https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=paul-graham-what-ameteur-meant[amateur]
philosopher / entertainer , then it would be less of a torture.

In this day and age people can learn enough about all that by starting
from https://www.shlomifish.org/[my homesite - www.shlomifish.org] and
following the text of the essays, stories and screenplays, and links.
While it took me a long time to hone my skills to my level, I wish
future people who wish to try to emulate me, to have an easier time. I
may be a badass writer and entertainer, but given that I know I should
https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/NSA/["Publish or Perish"]
and love to share my wisdom and knowledge anyway, and wish people to
learn from my mistakes and my successes.

Most of my screenplays, stories, bits, factoids,
https://www.youtube.com/user/ShlomiFish[the few videos I have on
YouTube] (which are very lame compared to the videos of Taylor Swift,
but they are a start), https://twitter.com/shlomif[my tweets] etc. were
inspired by thoughts I had during hypomanias, and I quite enjoy it.

Sometimes I get into periods of mild
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder[depressions]
during which I like to code a lot and to chat less passionately and
philosophically on IRC. Or I get into "deep work mode" when I write or
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring[refactor] / transition a
lot of code or churn a large amount of text. These are also ok.

Taylor Swift should not be worried from being medicated for being
Bipolar. She may do "strange" things such as:

* Paying for anything she orders from a meal down to a soft drink, a
glass of juice, or even some water, with a 50 USD bill telling the
vendor/waiter to keep the change or donate it to charity (or give it to
her, only to witness her leaving it on one of the tables for whoever
wishes to take it).
* Walk alone in the neighbourhood thinking.
* Staying up at night chatting in social media chat rooms
(e.g. https://freenode.net[Freenode], https://discordapp.com[Discord],
https://telegram.org[Telegram], and
https://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/How_Alternatives_Proliferate/[many
others]), while ordering food or drinks from time to time.
* Engage in conversations with complete strangers, to whom she will even
gladly https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1175578541292957696[give
money].
* Eat various foods based upon a whim. I once ordered a warm pasta meal
in the morning, and the restaurant complied.

Policemen are unlikely to detain her, and she can use social engineering
and
https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#benevolent-psychological-warfare[benevolent
psychological warfare] so they just give her a ride back home, or leave
her alone while thinking that her behaviour just "comes with the
territory".

Perhaps I have mischaracterised Ms. Swift here, but the point is that
these behaviours, although eccentric, unconventional, and non-conformist
are perfectly logical, and I will do the same if I were a wealthy
bipolar person.

[id="my_treatment"]
The Sad Story of My Treatment
-----------------------------

However, I am not so lucky.

In the break after my second Technion semester, I started writing
https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TOneW-the-Fountainhead/[The One With The Fountainhead] - which is a parodical crossover of
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fountainhead[Ayn Rand’s The Fountainhead] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends[the Friends T.V.  show], and which is one of the funniest, most politically incorrect, and
yet some people’s favourite of my screenplays.

Moreover, I corresponded with my friend https://zak.co.il/[Omer Zak] and
we came up with the opening meme to the
https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/SummerNSA/[Summerschool at the NSA] effort.

All of this made me maniacal and out of control and I came up with an
imaginary reality where
https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine[Star Trek DS9],
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer[Buffy],
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_the_Teenage_Witch_%281996_TV_series%29[Sabrina],
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarissa_Explains_It_All[CEIA]
https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Neo-Tech[Neo-Tech], various characters
from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism[Judaism] , some of their
actors, and some of my own friends and relatives, were real and
integrated together, and believed this was true.

I had done a lot of crazy stuff during my mania, but eventually a
psychiatrist asked me if I thought if it sounded logical that I could
read other people’s minds, and I told him it didn’t. As a result, I
snapped out of the mania.

Afterwards, I have been treated with harmful drugs that had many side
effects, and did not prevent future hypomanias or other mood swings.
Furthermore, my hypomanias were incredibly productive for me resulting
in stuff I placed on https://www.shlomifish.org/[my homesite] - and on
other social media sites, and which many similar minded hackers (both
male and female) enjoyed, complimented me for it, thought they were
funny, or alternatively thought they were
http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/[blasphemous (which indicates they were true)].

But the people who wanted me to be "mentally healthy" told me these
things were irrational, wrong, "schema-driven" and that they were
nonsense and that I should not give them weight.

They were wrong! They were insightful, fresh, and endured their time.

Now, while I have suffered from many harmful antipsychotics -
https://twitter.com/shc_mo/status/1180165973556506626[it may still be fixed] but what if instead of these harmful legal drugs, I would have
been treated with good therapy, possibly
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy[Cognitive behavioral therapy] or more preferably
https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#benevolent-psychological-warfare[Saladin-style benevolent therapy].

How many potential Taylor Swifts were forced to be a "Shlomi Fish"
like me, who despite all was very productive and insightful, or were
just hospitalised and sedated and fought against by mediocre minds, who
think conformism is mental health, while
https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/[it is the opposite]. Furthermore, conformism leads to Nazi-style
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_orders["Superior orders" / The "Nuremberg defense"], including the "I just work here"
https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2004/12/06/news-45/[small minded attitude] which leads to sadism and vandalism and loss of lives and
property that took a lot of effort to construct by hard working,
enthusiastic individuals.

So I say: "do what you want, not what you feel you must. The choice is
in your hands. Whatever you do, I’ll accept that." These words go back
at least to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses[Moses], were
http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Saladin_Style/[exemplified by Saladin] and were extended and conveyed by greater and greater "memes"
including https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7HiMv5jygk[Taylor Swift’s "Shake it Off" song] and the somewhat more established
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2RZXeQc5HU["Highway to Hell" song by AC/DC] (these are both links to two of my favourite covers of them).

=== A Million Psychiatrists can be wrong

Some people think that a million psychiatrists (and the mass media)
cannot be wrong, but they can. In other news, everyone
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth[knows the Earth is flat], and
that the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei[sun and all the planets revolve around the Earth], and that
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin[all species of animals were created about 6,000 years ago], and that
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell[unmarried couples living together and having premarital sex] is unethical and immoral. And,
naturally, homosexual individuals are a menace to society and must be
medicated and sedated.

=== Please don’t take anger the wrong way

My psychotherapist told me that anger and rage were typical of being
hypomanic. I feel that my rage, although criticised by other people,
does serve a useful and natural purpose.
